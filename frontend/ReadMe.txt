// frontend setup//
1. you can find the app at the Police GIS(hari krishna intern)\frontend\policeGIS\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
2. This app returns you results only when you change the request url in the code at the Each Screen at vaious user defined methods where
   we are trying to fetch the data asynchronously from the server. (please do change the url's ip with the new ip where your server is running)
   and also this is working in the local private network so make sure that the user's mobile phone and the system where the server is running is 
   connected to the same network.
3. This only works on an android device so please try to install this on an android device
4. Thumbs up!! now you can use the use without any interruptions :)
